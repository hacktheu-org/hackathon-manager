The HackathonManager community is here to help. While these docs are very much a work in progress, a lot of effort has gone into making HackathonManager as simple as possible to setup. If additional help is needed, resources can be found on this page. There is a large community of developers who want to see HackathonManager succeed so all questions are welcomed!

> See an area in the docs we can improve on? Click the `EDIT` button on any page and open a pull request with the changes! Feedback from the community on our docs is **greatly appreciated**.
